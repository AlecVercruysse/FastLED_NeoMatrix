FastLED NeoMatrix
=================

Adafruit_GFX-compatible library for NeoPixel matrices and grids. Controls single and tiled NeoPixel displays such as the [Adafruit NeoPixel Shield][shield] or grids assembled from [Adafruit 60 LED/meter Digital LED strip][strip]. Requires FastLED and Adafruit_GFX libraries.

This code was taken from Adafruit_NeoMatrix and adapted to work with the more powerful FastLED library.
