New demo to display gifs read from SPIFFS from ESP8266 (should also work on ESP32).
 
Decoding engine from Jason Coon, Aurora.

The gifs need to be uploaded to the ESP8266's SPIFFS.  You can do this within the Arduino IDE after installing the [Arduino ESP8266FS tool](http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.3.0/doc/filesystem.html#uploading-files-to-file-system).

With ESP8266FS installed upload the web app using `ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload` command in the Arduino Tools menu.
